/**
 * The order is the invariant. The brief is the child's own first `user-said`, without which
 * `awaitsReply` reads the thread as nobody's turn and the child never takes a step; `agent-spawned`
 * lands on the spawner's log, never on the child's.
 *
 * The spawn stays outside the child's transaction deliberately. Every write here runs under
 * `retryOnWriteConflict`, which re-runs the whole closure on SQLITE_BUSY, so a transaction spanning
 * both threads that lost the race to the parent's own live turn would roll back and mint a second
 * child thread on the retry. That trades a crash-sized window for a contention-sized one.
