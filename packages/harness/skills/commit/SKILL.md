name: commit
description: Stage the current work and write a conventional commit message for it.
argument-hint: [scope]
---

Review the staged and unstaged changes with `git status` and `git diff`, then commit them.

Write the message as `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — an imperative, lowercase description
under seventy-two characters. Pick the type from `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`,
`chore`. Add a body only when the change needs a reason that the diff cannot carry.

Never add attribution trailers. Never pass `--no-verify`. If the changes span more than one
concern, split them into separate commits rather than writing one message that hedges.
