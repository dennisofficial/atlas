# Daily-driver gaps

An audit of `apps/tui` + `packages/{core,harness}` against "could I use this instead of Claude Code
today". Ordered by what stops you, not by size.

Re-verified against the working tree on 2026-09-01 (second pass). What the code has closed since the
first pass is listed at the bottom. One caveat for this pass: the tree carries ~350 uncommitted
files spanning several in-flight slices (the web tools, most of the prompt prose, the provider
adapters, an effort-ladder rewrite, the approval machinery and the usage meter), so "closed" here
means "present and wired in the working tree", not necessarily committed.

## What already works

The loop (`harness/loop/run-turn.ts`), the event log, streaming into the transcript, steering a
running turn, undo, rewind, compaction on demand and automatically, background shells with the
sidebar, the `ctrl+t` panel and an exit guard that names what would die, twelve builtin tools,
instruction-file loading (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, nested, reloaded per turn), slash commands,
skills and the command menu, sub-agents with a sidebar roster and a readable child transcript,
the model/effort switcher, layered settings, a spend ledger, the raw
tape, markdown with two-tier syntax highlighting, table panning and side-by-side diffs, plan
mirroring from `task_write`, and an account vault that refreshes its own logins.

## P0 — blocks daily driving

Nothing. The transient-error retry landed (see "Closed").

## P1 — high friction

6. **The prompt prose landed; what remains is seeing it.** The registry is no longer four fragments
   but fifteen — `identity`, `workflow`, `scope`, `environment`, `files`, `tools`, `shells`, `plan`,
   `agents`, `safety`, `output`, `skills`, `memory`, `web` — covering the date/platform/git context,
   tone rules and tool-selection guidance the first pass called the cheapest quality win. Most of it
   is uncommitted in the tree. The open prompt-registry issues are `.scratch/prompt-registry/issues/`
   03 (the two composition roots can still disagree about the compiled prompt — `compose.ts` passes
   one, `build-harness.ts` does not) and 04 (a `/prompt` command to see what the model was told),
   which is `ready-for-human`. Issues 01 and 02 are still marked `ready-for-agent` but the code they
   describe exists — the statuses need walking, not the work.

8. **Sub-agents are built, bar one deliberate omission.** The feature shipped end to end — four
   agent types, five tools, a supervisor, a sidebar roster, a child transcript reachable by `ctrl+g`
   or `/agents`, `ctrl+k` to stop one, reports that reach the parent's prompt through
   `agentEndingsBlock`, endings that wake the parent, running children named in the exit guard,
   recovery that writes an ending for a child the session lost, and a delegated-cost line at the
   foot of the transcript. What remains:

   **No operator-facing spawn**, and that one is deliberate — choosing a type and writing a brief
   is the model's job, and a human who wants a sub-agent can ask for one in a sentence. `spawn`,
   `resume` and `types` stay model-only; `list`, `say` and `stop` are the three the TUI needs.

9. **Web access landed.** `WebFetchTool` and `WebSearchTool` are registered
   (`register-tools.ts:47-48`) and return the page rather than a small model's summary of it —
   `.scratch/web-tools/spec.md` records the design and why. The slice is uncommitted and ships
   without `__tests__` of its own, so it is verified by use rather than by suite.

10. **Cost across a session is invisible.** The ledger records four token tiers per turn, the
    generated catalogue carries prices, `ui/switcher-model.ts` renders a per-model price, and one
    conversation shows what its sub-agents cost as a line at the foot of the transcript
    (`readThreadSpend` over `forThreadTree`, tri-state so a failed read says so rather than
    reporting zero). What is still missing is the level above: no `/cost`, no total across
    conversations, no spend-to-date. The footer shows context pressure only. (The uncommitted usage
    slice — `core/usage/`, `harness/usage/`, an `AnthropicUsageClient` wired through `compose.ts`
    into the footer — is the *plan-window* meter, what a subscription has left, not a spend total.
    It answers a different question and does not close this.)

11. **User-authored commands and hooks.** Skills load from embedded + `~/.atlas/skills` + project,
    but there is no `.atlas/commands/*.md` equivalent, and hooks are compiled-in classes only — no
    settings-driven `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` shellouts.

12. **No headless mode.** `resolveConfig` understands `--model`, `--cwd`, `--resume`, `--continue`
    and `--new` — and nothing else, now that every configured knob is a setting reached through the
    layered file and its declared environment variable. No `-p/--print`, no stdin piping, no JSON
    output, so Atlas cannot be scripted or used in CI.

13. **Four providers are wired; reachability is now a credential question, not a code question.**
    The `harness/src/providers/` slice lands a `ProviderAdapter` abstraction with
    `AnthropicAdapter`, `OpenAiAdapter`, `OpenRouterAdapter` and `InferenceAdapter` all constructed
    in `compose.ts`, backed by a generated catalogue (`models/generated-catalogue.ts` +
    `models/generated/*.json`) covering Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter and inference.net rows. The
    inference.net slice is generated from that vendor's own `/v1/models` rather than models.dev,
    whose listing for it is stale. `modelIsReachable` and its Anthropic
    hard-code are gone: `providers.ts:66` marks a provider reachable when an account holds a key for
    it, and the switcher dims what you cannot actually call. What remains is operational, not
    architectural — signing into a second provider and driving it daily. The model-agnostic claim is
    no longer one adapter short; it is one login short.

14. **Images work.** Closed. `core/message` carries an `ImagePart`, `read` returns a picture for an
    image file, ctrl+v pulls a screenshot off the macOS clipboard, and `imagesInContext` stops old
    ones being re-billed every step. Rendering goes through OpenTUI 0.5.9's native
    `ImageRenderable` at `protocol="auto"`, so a terminal answering the kitty handshake gets real
    full-resolution pixels and everything else falls back to quadrant glyphs; decode is native, so
    PNG, JPEG, WebP and GIF all paint. Remaining limits are narrow: clipboard pull is macOS-only,
    and tmux forces the block fallback.

## Accepted, not gaps

**The approval posture flipped since the first audit — this section now records what changed rather
than what was declined.** The first pass said "no classifier, no permission lists, no approval UI,
and that is intended". The tree now carries exactly that machinery, committed over the last several
passes: a seven-probe classifier in `core/policy/classifier` (irreversibility, reach, contention,
shared history, exposure, provenance, blast radius — each raising signals keyed to an exact subject
so a grant clears the one thing it names), a shell reader that parses a command into segments and
resolved paths instead of matching substrings, and an approval flow whose answered question settles
the call rather than re-asking it. The TUI renders the request through `use-approval.ts` and an
overlay in `app.tsx`. The design intent lives in `.scratch/auto-classifier/spec.md` — a nudge before
irreversible or cross-agent damage, not a permission wall — and its eleven issues are all still
marked `ready-for-agent` despite the code existing, so like the prompt-registry they need their
statuses walked.

The routing decision from the first audit is now live code: **a sub-agent's `Ask` never reaches the
human overlay.** `tools/approval-routing.ts` gives a child exactly two routings — `Operator` when a
human is attached, `None` otherwise — and the `None` reason tells the child to report what it wanted
and let the main thread propose it. Whether the parent can *answer* a blocked child's approval
(rather than the child declining up front) is the piece the spec leaves to the approval effort.

`ReadBeforeWriteHook` remains the only other `BeforeToolHook`; `WorkspaceBoundaryHook` stays
deleted, and nothing reintroduces location-based containment.

## P2 — parity items, deliberately deferred

MCP server lifecycle, sandbox/container isolation, PR shipping, phases and phase briefs, session
rotation across accounts, `/doctor`, `/export`, terminal-title updates, notification bell, vim mode,
transcript search, and `core/budget/resolveBudget` as the auto-compaction controller.
`docs/architecture.md` names most of these; none needs a decision reopened.

## Closed since the first audit

- **Transient errors retry automatically.** (Was P0 1.) `loop/retrying-step.ts` wraps the model
  step and is the path `run-turn.ts` takes: `modelFailureOf` classifies the cause out of
  `model/failure.ts` — status, and seconds out of a `retry-after` header — `planRetry` in
  `core/models/retry.ts` decides under `DEFAULT_RETRY_POLICY`, and the sleep is abortable so
  interrupting a waiting turn does not hang. The operator sees the wait as a shimmering countdown in
  the working line (`ui/retry-countdown.ts`, `working-line.tsx`) naming the attempt, the ceiling and
  the reason. `model/faulting-model.ts` is a dev-only decorator driven by `ATLAS_FAULT_*` env vars
  that throws exactly what a live 429/529 would, so the retry path is exercisable without an outage.
  A failure that is not transient — including a bug in our own code reaching the same catch — is not
  retried: `modelFailureOf` answers null and the turn fails as before, with `ctrl+r` still the
  manual recovery.

- **Web access.** (Was P1 9.) See the P1 entry; the tools are registered and the spec is landed.

- **The prompt prose.** (Was P1 6.) See the P1 entry; fifteen fragments, mostly uncommitted, with
  issues 03/04 still open.

- **A second and third provider.** (Was P1 13.) See the P1 entry; adapters and generated catalogue
  are in the tree, reachability is keyed on credentials.

- **Sub-agents run.** A child is a real thread Atlas spawned — its own row carrying
  `spawnerThreadId` and `agentType`, its log and brief written in one transaction by
  `createWithFirstEvents`, its loop stepped unawaited under its own `AbortController`. Two things
  distinguish it from the main agent and no others: the five agent tools are denied to it, which
  caps depth at one by construction, and its system prompt is its agent type's prose compiled under
  `EPromptAgent.Sub`. Four types ship embedded and `~/.atlas/agents/*.md` and
  `<project>/.atlas/agents/*.md` shadow them project over user over built-in, with a refusal rather
  than silence for a definition that will not load. Reports reach the parent's model through
  `agentEndingsBlock`, which collapses a wave of endings into one spliced block on a shared prose
  budget. `ctrl+g` and `/agents` walk to a child, `ctrl+k` stops one, and the ending says who
  stopped it — `EKilledBy` now covering `Unrecorded` for a child the session lost before it could
  report. Five of the six fork invariants in `docs/architecture.md` closed on the way, including the
  rewind hole — a cut below a live child was once refused outright; it now asks once, naming what
  dies, and a confirmed rewind destroys the child with the delegation.

- **Read-before-write is per thread, locked, and content-aware.** `ToolCall` carries a required
  `threadId` and `FileReadStatePort` keys views on `{ threadId, path }`, so a sub-agent's read no
  longer vouches for its parent's write. `FileWriteGuardPort.underLock` puts the whole
  verify-then-write inside a per-path in-process mutex, which **eliminates** the agent-versus-agent
  race outright — every sub-agent runs in this process — and `FileView.digest`, consulted by
  `movedSince` only when mtime and size agree, closes the content-blind predicate. A concurrent
  external editor is **narrowed and not closed**, which no in-process lock can do; `writeFileAtomically`
  is a separate guarantee again, that no reader sees a half-written file.

- **A run from a checkout keeps its state in the checkout.** `atlasDirectory()` now resolves through
  `core/workspace/atlas-home.ts`: `ATLAS_HOME` wins if set, otherwise a source launch lands in
  `<repo>/.atlas-home` and only the compiled binary uses `~/.atlas`. The binary is told apart by its
  modules living under Bun's `/$bunfs` mount, so `bun run dev`, `bun src/main.tsx` and `bun test` all
  get the local home without a flag. Database, settings, tapes, skills and the account vault follow
  it, each writer already `mkdir -p`-ing its own directory, and `importClaudeCodeAccount` re-seeds a
  fresh dev home from `~/.claude` on boot. `dev.db` is gone: dev and shipped state are separated by
  home now, not by filename, so the default database is `harness.db` in both.

- **`@`-file mentions, browsed like `cd`.** `core/mentions/file-mention.ts` parses `@path` out of a
  message — past email addresses, `react@19` and code spans — and `core/mentions/browse.ts` splits
  what is being typed into the directory to list and the fragment to filter it by. `FileBrowser`
  (harness) reads one level at a time and resolves `~`, an absolute path and a climb out of the
  workspace alike, so `@~/Developer/other-project/` browses as readily as `@src/`. `⇥` on a
  directory appends its slash and opens the next level; on a file it settles with a space. Rows
  read as one path, folders dimmed and the name lit, shortened powerlevel10k-style from the
  outside in when the row is too narrow (`ui/path-shorten.ts`). A chosen path attaches as
  `EContextSlot.File`: text truncated at 128 KB with a notice, a directory as its listing,
  anything binary refused. The composer paints a mention only once the filesystem has confirmed it
  — one question per spelling, memoised — so what is lit is what will be attached, and a mention
  that names nothing sends as ordinary prose. `ui/highlight-offsets.ts` carries the one quirk that
  costs: `addHighlightByCharRange` addresses the buffer with line breaks removed.

- **A session picker.** `/resume` lists the conversations in this workspace off the `list()` the
  store already exposed, through `use-threads.ts` and `ui/threads-model.ts`.

- **A conversation belongs to a workspace.** `87ab439b` added `workspace` and `repo` to `Thread`
  with an `@@index([workspace, updatedAt])`, `core/workspace/identity.ts` and the harness probe that
  resolves them. `mostRecent` and `list` are both scoped, and a thread predating the attribution is
  adopted by whoever opens it by id, so opening Atlas in a second repo no longer resumes the first
  one's conversation with the wrong `CLAUDE.md` in the log.

- **Credentials refresh themselves, hold more than one account, and no longer need macOS.**
  `RefreshingCredentialPort` reads an account out of `~/.atlas/auth.json` (0600, aes-256-gcm under
  `~/.atlas/key`), refreshes inside a five-minute skew with one in-flight exchange per account, and
  writes the rotated pair back to the Claude Code keychain item it was imported from so `claude`
  keeps working. `ctrl+a` / `/auth` lists accounts, signs in by pasted code, takes an API key,
  switches and removes; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` shows up as an account of its own. A boot that cannot
  authenticate now opens the overlay carrying the reason instead of exiting.
- **Auto-compaction is wired.** `useConversation.compactIfFull` runs after every turn against
  `ESettingId.AutoCompact` (`context.autoCompact`, 90% by default). Only `resolveBudget`, the
  fixpoint controller, is still unused.
- **The prompt registry** replaced the five-line `MINIMAL_PREAMBLE` literal with DI-resolved
  fragments. `assembly/rules/system-preamble.ts` is deleted.
- **Interrupt granularity.** `tools/builtin/bash.ts:190` terminates on abort and
  `shells/shell-process.ts:45` signals the whole process group via `setsid`, SIGTERM then SIGKILL
  after a grace period. Partial output is preserved.
- **The failing slash-command test** (`app-commands.spec.tsx:190`, stray newline on completion) — the
  completion path was rewritten.
- **The `ctrl+c` exit guard** now names the background shells that would die, and refuses to go
  stale or let a turn start behind it.

## Health

- `bun run typecheck` was clean across core, harness and tui at the first audit; it has not been
  re-run against the current uncommitted tree (see the last item in this section).
- **The `bash` sleep guard refused commands it should have allowed.** `waitsBySleeping`
  (`core/shells/idling.ts`, added in `2579aa3f`) ran before `timeoutMs` was known, so a command that
  could not outlive its explicit 300 ms ceiling was refused for "spending 32 seconds asleep" — which
  is what broke `BashTool > kills the whole process group on timeout`. The check now runs after the
  timeout is resolved and measures `idledSeconds` as the lesser of the sleeping and the timeout.

  Two flaws in it remain, both needing real shell parsing rather than a regex: `sleptSeconds` sums
  across `&`, so concurrent sleeps of 2 s and 30 s read as 32 s; and it cannot tell a `sleep` inside
  quoted data from one that will run, so a heredoc *containing* the text `sleep 120` is refused.
- **`test` declares `dependsOn: ["^test"]`, so one harness failure hides the whole tui suite.**
  While that `bash` test was red, `bun run test` reported "1 successful, 2 total" and never ran
  `@dltech/atlas` at all. Worth knowing independently of the bug that exposed it: a single upstream
  failure silently blanks downstream signal.
- **The tui suite went from 8m17s to 18.5s.** Fixed, and worth writing down because two plausible
  diagnoses were wrong before the right one turned up.

  The earlier "exceeds five minutes" figure was measured with `bun test` at the repo root, which
  sweeps `deprecated/` — meaningless. Honest baseline: core + harness **15 s** via turbo, tui
  **1926 pass / 0 fail in 8m17s**, of which only 54 s was user CPU. The suite was idle-waiting, not
  computing, and every wait in it was a *worst case* charged as a *fixed cost*.

  What actually paid off, in order:

  1. `teardown` (`markdown/__tests__/harness.ts`) slept `HIGHLIGHT_SETTLE_MS = 400` on all 138 call
     sites. It now polls for a settled frame with 400 ms as a *ceiling*, so an in-flight tree-sitter
     highlight still gets its full grace and everything else returns in ~10 ms. Same for `drawn`
     (`transcript-fixture.tsx`) and its 250 ms. Those two took the serial run to **158 s**;
     `transcript-render` + `tool-group-render` alone went 78 s → 6.2 s.
  2. `app-rewind.spec.tsx` had its own helpers with `settle(1_500)` per message — 45 s in one file.
     Rewritten against `frameShowing({ setup, text })`, which returns the instant the text lands:
     **48.9 s → 6.5 s**, same 22 assertions.
  3. Sharding across processes (`scripts/test-shards.ts`): **158 s → 18.5 s**.

  Two things that did *not* work, so nobody retries them:

  - **`bun test --parallel` is unusable here.** It implies `--isolate`, and @opentui/core 0.4.5
    cannot initialise its Zig render library in an isolated worker — every `testRender` dies with
    "Cannot access 'default' before initialization". It runs in 5 s and fails 442 tests. `--shard`
    uses ordinary processes and is fine. Revisit when that upstream bug is fixed.
  - **`waitFor` / `waitForFrame` from @opentui/core are not general-purpose waits.** Both break out
    of their loop the moment the scheduler reports no running, rendering or scheduled work, so
    neither can span an await the renderer knows nothing about — a scripted model step, a summariser
    delay. That is why the original author reached for sleeps. `frameWhen` in
    `ui/__tests__/waiting.ts` polls the captured frame with a yield instead, which does span them.

  And one real constraint: **a settled frame is not a safe wait for an animated screen.** Two
  captures taken microseconds apart match while the interrupt spinner or shimmer is still moving, so
  `app-fixture.frame()` keeps its timed settle deliberately — swapping it cost three failures in
  `app-resume` and `app-undo`, and the comment there now says why.
- **`act()` warnings** throughout the composition specs.
- `composition/use-conversation.ts` is back under the line at 316, but `composition/app.tsx` grew to
  943 — it is now the worst offender against the 300-line rule by a factor of three, and the
  approval overlay wiring landed in it.
- 346 uncommitted files (204 modified, 135 new, 7 deleted) spanning at least six slices: the web
  tools, the prompt-prose fragments, the provider adapters + generated catalogue, an effort-ladder
  rewrite (`models/effort.ts` → `effort-ladder.ts`, `anthropic-thinking.ts` → per-provider
  `*-effort.ts`), the approval machinery, and the usage meter. The slices look coherent, but the
  tree is one bad `git checkout` away from losing a week, and nothing in "What already works" above
  has been verified by CI since these landed — typecheck and test status against this exact tree is
  unconfirmed.


## Suggested order

The old order is done — retry, prose and web all landed. What remains, re-ordered by what a daily
driver feels:

1. **Commit the tree.** Not a feature, but 346 files across six working slices is the riskiest
   thing in the repo right now, and it gates everything below being real. Run typecheck and the
   suites first — nothing has since these slices landed.
2. **Walk the issue statuses.** `.scratch/prompt-registry/issues/01-02` and
   `.scratch/auto-classifier/issues/01-11` describe code that exists; only prompt-registry 03/04 are
   genuinely open. Stale `ready-for-agent` labels will send the next agent looking for work that is
   done.
3. **`/cost`.** (P1 10) The last invisible-everyday-number.
4. **Headless mode.** (P1 12) What makes Atlas scriptable and CI-able.
5. **User-authored commands and hooks.** (P1 11)
6. **Drive a second provider.** (P1 13) A login, not a build.
