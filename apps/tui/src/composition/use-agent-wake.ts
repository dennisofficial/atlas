/**
 * A child that ends while nothing is running has no turn to be delivered into, so the ending is
 * what starts one. Mid-turn there is nothing to do: the loop drains the same queue on its next
 * pass.
 *
 * A turn must not start behind a prompt that has taken the keyboard, so an overlay waiting on an
 * answer holds the wake off until it is closed. The ending keeps until then.
 *
 * Only this thread's endings are read, and only this thread is woken: a child belongs to whoever
 * spawned it.
