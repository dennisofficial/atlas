 * Two preferences, one picker. A conversation carries the model it was last switched to, so two
 * terminals on two threads stop fighting over one remembered pair; the settings row carries what a
 * conversation with nothing of its own begins on.
 *
 * The default is read where the thread is adopted rather than followed, so raising it in the
 * settings reaches the next conversation instead of the one on screen. The order of the effects is
 * the other invariant: the thread's pair reaches the harness before anything is written back, so
 * the write sees the model this thread is on rather than the one the thread before it left behind.
