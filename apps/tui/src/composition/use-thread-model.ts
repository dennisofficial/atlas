/**
 * Two preferences, one picker. A conversation carries the model it was last switched to, so two
 * terminals on two threads stop fighting over one remembered pair; the settings row carries what a
 * conversation with nothing of its own begins on.
 *
 * The default is followed only while the thread has no model of its own — never started, never
 * switched on screen — so a default picked after adoption (onboarding's) still reaches the first
 * conversation instead of leaving it on the launch fallback. Once the thread has started or been
 * switched, raising the default reaches the next conversation instead of the one on screen. The
 * order of the effects is the other invariant: the thread's pair reaches the harness before
 * anything is written back, so the write sees the model this thread is on rather than the one the
 * thread before it left behind.
