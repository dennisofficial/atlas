/**
 * A background shell that ends while nothing is running has no turn to be delivered into, so the
 * ending is what starts one. Mid-turn there is nothing to do: the loop drains the same queue on its
 * next pass.
 *
 * A turn must not start behind a prompt that has taken the keyboard, so an overlay waiting on an
 * answer holds the wake off until it is closed. The ending keeps until then.
 *
 * Only this thread's endings are read, and only this thread is woken: a shell belongs to whoever
 * started it.
