/**
 * A picture that shows itself only while all of it fits on screen.
 *
 * Warp accepts a kitty placement's cell box but discards its source rectangle, so a half-scrolled
 * image arrives as the whole picture crushed into the rows that remain rather than as the crop that
 * was asked for. Measured on Warp v0.2026.08.19: a placement of `y=200,h=200` against a four-band
 * image painted all four bands, not the requested bottom half.
 *
 * Nothing can be done about that from here except decline to ask for a crop. Since a transcript
 * image is already held shorter than the viewport, there is always a scroll position that shows the
 * whole thing, and withholding it either side of that reads as scrolling away rather than melting.
